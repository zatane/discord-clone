# Tech Stack Overview

This file outlines the technology stack used in the Discord Clone project, detailing each component's role and why it was chosen.

## 1. React
- **Description**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where a responsive and dynamic interaction is key.
- **Why React**: Its component-based architecture allows for reusable UI components, making the development process more efficient and organized.

## 2. Node.js
- **Description**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, adding the capabilities to run JavaScript on the server side.
- **Why Node.js**: It allows for building fast and scalable network applications. The event-driven model helps in handling multiple connections simultaneously.

## 3. PostgreSQL
- **Description**: An advanced, enterprise-class open-source relational database management system (RDBMS).
- **Why PostgreSQL**: It provides robust features, supports complex queries, and is highly scalable for growing applications.

## 4. TypeScript
- **Description**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types, facilitating better tooling and debugging.
- **Why TypeScript**: It helps catch errors early through type-checking, making the codebase more maintainable in the long run.

## 5. WebRTC
- **Description**: A free, open-source project that provides web browsers and mobile applications with real-time communication capabilities via simple application programming interfaces (APIs).
- **Why WebRTC**: It allows for direct peer-to-peer communication, enabling real-time features like audio and video calls without the need for a server in between.

## 6. Socket.io
- **Description**: A library that enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between the browser and the server.
- **Why Socket.io**: It simplifies the process of implementing real-time web applications and is built on top of WebSockets, providing fallback options for older browsers.
